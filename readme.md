JDBFO - Japanese Duplex BFO
A handwired Keebio, BFO9000 based on code from the angel64 to support japanese duplex because I was really new and didn't think about how many pins i needed. 
It has 3 rotary encoders and an oled display and is a 6x9 split with a fully 3d printed case. 

Created as a final project for school and I'll probably make a guide because I've seen many people ask questions about Jduplex like myself but not getting many answers because its not that well documented even if it is very usefull.
